# Tokens
A repository for managing token richlists. Data stored in this repository is used to build the tokens richlists at https://analytics.smartstake.io

The listing of any tokens on smart stake is not an endorsement for the token. This is currently a free service for all the tokens. If you like to support Smart Stake, consider staking with Smart Stake and/or encouraging your communities to stake with Smart Stake.


# Instructions to add a new token

Prechecks:
 1. Confirm that Smart Stake supports the network on which you have launched the token. SmartStake.io lists all supported networks.
 2. Confirm that the token being requested for listing is a token factory token

Instructions:
 1. Fork this repository
 2. In your own instance of the repository, check to see if TokenSymbol.json file is present (e.g. BULLS.json)
 3. Create TokenSymbol.json file (e.g. BULLS.json) with below structure and enter all the information that is available. The JSON file has below given structure (see sample values & explanation). Please pay attention to the case of attributes (e.g. logoUrl is the correct attribute logourl and LOGOURL are wrong). Also note that the full structure must be present, if you dont have some of the information, you can leave that as null (without any double quotes)
 
```   
{
    "name": "Alpha Bulls", # mandatory (the comments mentioned here should not be added to the json file you submit. see any of the existing file for reference)
    "ticker": "BULLS", # mandatory
    "network": "INJ", # mandatory - ticker for the network where the token is minted

Try total supply API for the network to figure out the correct input e.g. https://rest.cosmos.directory/injective/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/supply. For token factory tokens, it will be like: factory/inj1zq37mfquqgud2uqemqdkyv36gdstkxl27pj5e3/bulls. For an IBC asset, it will be like: ibc/0EC78B75D318EA0AAB6160A12AEE8F3C7FEA3CFEAD001A3B103E11914709F4CE
